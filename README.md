# Setup
1. Cypress

# Test Case Description
1. E-Trust Shop Title Verification - Verify the title
2. Grade Review - It review the grade on "bekleidung" , as page is not mentioned and as per requirment sequence after landing page it should verify the grade, However I assumed it to be any page so I used "bekleidung". In the logs it will capture the mail address based on the two criteria
a. Grade equal to zero and Grade greater than 0 and b. Grade greater than 0.
3. Has moreReview grade- It review the grade on first 3 pages in the same way as test case #2. It stops at page 4.

# Requirement Understanding
Click on “Mangelhaft” and validate that it loaded some reviews- this requirement is unclear - need more information.

# Addition Information
Since, some of the requirements are not clear and I assumed few points.On high-level I understand what is required from these requirements so this code will try to fullfill the objective of the regression.
